Arduino Raw Serial
==================

Exploration of Node-RED and Arduino simple serial communication using Serial.print, Serial.read in Arduino sketches combined with Node-RED nodes serial in, serial out.

To simplify recording notes and documentation, much of the research content is in the [repository wiki](https://github.com/mMerlin/NodeRedSimpleSerial/wiki/). Where it is easy to access and update, without needing edit, commit, push cycles.
